## Using the App

You will need a Mac with XCode to run the iOS app, and some bitcoin.

You are an owner or manager of many locations (the "stores") interested in participating in the BlockHunt program. You'll need to fill up your store's accounts with bitcoins to disperse to eager visitors, and be prepared with a QR code to be displayed at each location.
